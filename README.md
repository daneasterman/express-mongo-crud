### A CRUD Express Web App  

Demonstrates main "create", "read", "update" and "delete" operations with Express and MongoDB noSQL database.

Based on the tutorial by Zell Liew here: [https://zellwk.com/blog/crud-express-mongodb/](https://zellwk.com/blog/crud-express-mongodb/)

Uses RESTFUL routes, the express way in `server.js` for example: GET, POST and PUT.

Also demonstrates use of EJS templating library. 

**Instructions to run the project on your local computer:** After `git  clone`, all dependencies should be in `package.json` so just run `npm install` in project directory.

**N.B:** This project uses local "environment variable" for MongoDB url reference. This will *not* work "straight out of the box" for your own cloned copy.  Set up your own free 500mb sandbox to run the MongoDB database here: [https://mlab.com/](https://mlab.com/)
